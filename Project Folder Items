This file contains everything Aquatic Ambiance (hereby named by "us" or "the Team") did for our NeonSea project (hereby named "our Project" or "the Project"), presented at Lumifest, on a weekend in October 2023.

Here lies the Master Folder of the Project :

But don't worry, I'll guide you through every important part and subsections of this wonderfully crafted masterpiece.

Firstly, if you like boring stuff, unlike any of us, you'd want to take a look at this folder :
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12j8jPVw5URxr1HD4EQo7DFo_OwnPigS6?usp=share_link

It contains our TimeSheets, our list of exepenses, our Mandate, our Cahier de Charge and our first Pitch presented to Dominique.


Now, I know you were probably halfway through falling asleep reading this admin stuff. But it is now time for the fun stuff to begin !

So, here it goes : our individual work folders. 
It might not contain what everyone of us did. Some things went directly in the recycle bin. But if that's the case, it's probably better that way. 

Let's start with William's folder. 
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rcgYVl0NKISNtM3qSvhFhzw5hls3XL6t?usp=share_link

His folder contains some Alphas, Betas and final versions of his renders. Some Blender workfiles, some Render test images and some FBX components that others used. 

Then comes Tristan's folder. 
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14IbWK_aEXRt3Wyyk3JicOF3fH47tewKo?usp=share_link

It contains a boat FBX, used in 2 scenes, a prospectus of our working space around the festival and a TouchDesigner file for the Wave scene. 

Then, in Raphael's folder, there is a lot of versions of the same scene. The most important version is the latest one. It also contains  some preliminary versions of our audio work. 
It can be found here :

Time to talk about Gabriel's folder. It can be found right here :
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OpRnBUWNETURyBXKC5eey3PC41Bc6xkd?usp=share_link

It contains a preliminary version of a Kinect interaction TouchDesigner file, which was declined by the client. It also contains his Blender scene, some render images and our Item Checklist used to gather all the equipment needed.

Clément's folder can be found here : 
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1egnz3fXLUAbEOX6zSmbyi980pdSLtK7Q?usp=share_link

It contains all the TouchDesigner Files for the DMX StageLight, the LaserCube interaction with the arduino + Video Player file. The latter is very, very interesting to take a look at.

Ariane's folder is very straightfoward. It contains her Turtle scene, some Fonts for the Pitch we did back in January/February and a 3D scan of the location. 
It can be found right here :
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15HfZM6K_h9y4Jtxz1V1HWcJivplY7jiG?usp=share_link

Finally, my folder, named Sasha, contains Arduino test files, video renders of 3 distinct scenes and 2 extra scenes that were presented back during the Pitch.
It can be found here :

Now, you might think the fun/most important part is over. You are wrong. 
At the root of the folder lies the 2 most important images, that will save you so much trouble and time. There are 2 images of the same equipment piece. Yes, the pictures of a light sensor.
Without them, we never would've been able to accomplish what we did on March 22nd.

But, as you might have seen, I haven't said anything about our Final Assets' Folder. Yes, the one right here : 
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NqhjZj9CXaFJdRz8wLs37aSLxHV0jtJs?usp=share_link
This contains every final items we needed in order to present. The Final Videos, Final Songs, the 2 TouchDesigner Files and our final Blender Files.
This is the last Folder we've created, but it is now the core of the Project. 

I wish you safe travels through our files. 
If anything, I will try to answer any question you may have about the whole Project.
